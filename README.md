Using deep reinforcement learning as a means of learning to efficiently search on graphs. The problem of graph search is framed as an MDP where the state-space encodes the graph at any time during the search and the actions taken by the network would explore the graph to find a path from a start state to the goal state. 

This is the course project for 10703: Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control.
